# MCANet

This is the official repository of **Multi-Scale Cross-Dimensional Attention Network for Gland Segmentation.**

# Prepare data
Detailed data is available [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/EBHISEG/21540159/1?file=38179080).

# Some gland image features are shown in the figure

## Model Architecture
The architecture consists of the following components:
![Model Architecture](./figures/MCANet.png)

### 1. **PMA**
   - We propose parallel multi-scale attention (PMA) mechanism, which preserves pixels' spatial position information through the aggregation of cross-channel and multi-scale information to more accurately distinguish the edge region from other regions of glandular images.

### 2. **CDA**
   - We propose a Cross-Dimensional Attention (CDA) mechanism that captures dependencies across the $(C, H)$, $(C, W)$, and $(H, W)$ dimensions through three separate branches. This enables interactive modeling of channel and spatial dimensions in complex gland images to improve the accuracy of gland image segmentation.

### 3. **Multi-scale Skip Connection**
   - We design a multi-scale skip connection module to fuse features from different semantic scales. This module not only preserves detailed information but also enhances the model's contextual awareness, enabling effective extraction and fusion of both local and global information for gland image segmentation.

## Installation

You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

## Usage
Here is an example of how to use the MCANet for segmentation:
```bash
import torch
from MCANet_C import MCANet_C
model = MCANet_C(n_channels=3, n_classes=1)
```

```bash
import torch
from MCANet_R import MCANet_R
model = MCANet_R(n_channels=3, n_classes=1)
```
